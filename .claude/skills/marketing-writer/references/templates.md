Your file system is a mess.
Folders within folders within folders.

• Search across all your documents at once
• Find files by content, not just names
• Filter by date, type, or project

Click "Search" in the top bar or press Cmd+K to try it.

More features coming next month (including saved searches).

Give it a shot,
Alex

P.S. Works on mobile too. Finally.
