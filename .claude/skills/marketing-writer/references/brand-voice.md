# Brand Voice Guidelines

## Core Principles

**Casual and direct, like talking to a friend**
- Write as if you're texting someone you respect
- Use contractions (you're, it's, we've)
- Start sentences with "And" or "But" when natural
- Ask rhetorical questions to engage
- Use second person ("you") liberally

**No corporate buzzwords or cringe marketing speak**
Never use these words:
- Synergy
- Leverage (as a verb)
- Solutions
- Revolutionary
- Game-changing
- Innovative (unless truly novel)
- Best-in-class
- Industry-leading
- Seamless
- Robust
- Cutting-edge
- Empower
- Transform
- Disrupt
- Next-generation
- World-class

**Focus on real benefits, not hype**
- Specific outcomes over vague promises
- Numbers and time savings when possible
- What users actually get, not features for features' sake
- Real problems solved, not invented ones

**Use simple language, avoid jargon**
- Assume 8th-grade reading level
- Explain technical terms if you must use them
- Short sentences (15-20 words max usually)
- Active voice, not passive
- One idea per sentence

## Voice Examples

### Good ✅

**Landing page copy:**
"Search your files instantly. No folders, no clicking around. Type what you need and it's there in 2 seconds."

**Tweet:**
"Spent 10 minutes looking for a file I saved yesterday. This is why search beats folders every time."

**Email:**
"Hey, remember when you couldn't find that contract last week? That problem is solved. We just added instant search."

---

### Bad ❌

**Landing page copy:**
"Leverage our cutting-edge search technology to seamlessly discover your documents with industry-leading speed and precision."

**Tweet:**
"We're excited to announce our revolutionary search feature that will transform how you interact with your digital assets!"

**Email:**
"Dear Valued User, We are pleased to inform you that we have implemented an innovative solution to optimize your document retrieval experience."

## Tone Adjustments by Channel

### Landing Pages
- Confidence without arrogance
- Benefits-first, features-second
- Scannable (headers, bullets, short paragraphs)
- Clear CTAs without pressure

### Tweets
- More casual, can be snarky
- Opinion and personality welcome
- Thread first tweet = hook, last tweet = CTA
- Relatable pain points work well

### Emails
- Most personal, use "I" and "we"
- Acknowledge user context when possible
- One clear action per email
- P.S. can be playful or add bonus info

### Product Updates
- Excited but not overhyped
- "Here's what's new" not "We're thrilled to announce"
- Quick explanation → benefit → how to use
- Acknowledge if it solves a requested feature

## Sentence Starters to Use

Instead of corporate starters, use these:
- "Here's how..."
- "You can now..."
- "This means..."
- "The result?"
- "Why this matters:"
- "Quick thing:"
- "Real talk:"

## How to Write Product Descriptions

1. Start with the problem (relatable, specific)
2. Show the solution (simple explanation)
3. List the benefit (concrete outcome)
4. Add proof if available (numbers, testimonials)
5. Clear CTA (remove friction)

**Example:**
❌ "Our platform enables seamless collaboration across teams"
✅ "Share files with your team. They get a link, they see the file. No accounts required."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Being too clever:** Clarity > creativity
2. **Burying the benefit:** Lead with what users get
3. **Passive voice:** "Files can be searched" → "Search your files"
4. **Hedging:** Remove "we think", "possibly", "might be able to"
5. **Fake excitement:** Skip "We're excited to announce"
6. **Feature lists:** Always connect features to benefits
7. **Jargon:** Technical accuracy matters less than comprehension

## Quick Checklist

Before publishing any marketing content, verify:
- [ ] Would I actually talk like this to a friend?
- [ ] Did I remove all buzzwords?
- [ ] Is the benefit clear in the first sentence?
- [ ] Could a non-technical person understand this?
- [ ] Is every word necessary?
- [ ] Did I avoid passive voice?
- [ ] Is the CTA obvious and easy?
